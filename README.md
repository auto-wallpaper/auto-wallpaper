> Before you download: Unfortunately, leronardo.ai has added a Cloudflare captcha at the login page, preventing Auto Wallpaper from doing the automation. Currently, the automation has been written using HTTP requests in Rust. but now, a rewrite is needed in a browser-based automation such as Puppeteer or better, in a Rust automation library. Right now, I'm so busy and working on other projects. So, I'm not sure if I will get enough time to update it. if you know how to bypass captchas and have knowledge in browser automation/crawling, I would appreciate your help by contributing the code or even guiding me for a faster update. Rust or Typescript, both are accepted

### Why I made this application?
Honestly, my goal was to take a look at [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) and learn it. So I built this open-source and non-profit project. Any PR is welcome and if you found a bug, i will be so glad if you report it in [issues](https://github.com/auto-wallpaper/auto-wallpaper/issues).

### Development Environment

This project is built using the `created-t3-turbo` template (https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo), which utilizes `Turborepo` (https://turbo.build/repo/docs) and focuses on TypeScript. It currently has a single application, `tauri-app`, developed with Tauri (https://v2.tauri.app/). The project is currently undergoing migration from Tauri v1 to v2.

#### Prerequisites:

- **Node.js:** Version 20.10.0 or above
- **pnpm:** Version 9.2.0 or above (other package managers are not supported)
- **Rust and Tauri prerequisites:** Follow the official Tauri documentation: https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/

#### Getting Started:

1. **Fork and Clone this project.**
2. **Install dependencies:** Navigate to the project's root directory and run `pnpm i`.
3. **Available commands:**
   - `pnpm dev`: Starts the application in development mode.
   - `pnpm build`: Builds the application for local execution.
   - `pnpm add -F tauri-app <package-name>`: Adds a new package to the project.

#### Note for Local Development:

To run the application locally, make sure to disable the updater in `apps/tauri-app/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`. Remove `plugins.updater`. This is because the updater requires a private key, which is not set for local development environments. If you want to use your own updater signature, refer to the Tauri documentation: https://v2.tauri.app/plugin/updater/#signing-updates

#### Contributions:

We welcome your contributions! Feel free to share your ideas, experiences, and pull requests (PRs) to help improve the project.

### DISCLAIMER
This project is purely for educational purposes and is not intended for commercial gain. It will remain open-source indefinitely.

This application utilizes automated interactions with other web services:
- [leonardo.ai](https://leonardo.ai/) for image generation and upscaling
- [1secmail.com](https://1secmail.com/) for temp emails

We respect the terms of service of these platforms and will readily remove any automation upon request from their owners.
